Codes for reproducing analyses in: A poly(A) isoform–aware single-cell and spatial atlas defines fibroblast niches in the human bladder

Included are the codes and files requisite to reproduce polyA isoform reference harmonization, fractional usage and differential APA, Xenium cell type and transcript luminal distance, Recon3D, ClusterProfiler, and METAFlux analyses included in this paper. Codes for snRNA-seq clustering and scPASU implementation are available via pre-existing Zenodo submissions provided in the paper.
